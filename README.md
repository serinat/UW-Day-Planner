### UW-Day-Planner

- The objective of this homework is to create a dynamic scheduler that allows a user to save events for each hour between 9AM and 5PM at each hour, using dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery. My first step in tackling this homework was a homework workshop after class where we pseudocoded the project. When I got home that evening, I tried to build rows to the page but had a difficult time. Tonight after class I encountered the same issues so I decided to hard code the rows as a start and see if I can get the functionality to work. More to come..
